## Project Overview  
ChargeHub Berlin is a platform designed to help users locate electric charging stations in Berlin, visualize their distribution alongside population density, and manage interactions like ratings and reviews. Users can sign up, log in, search for charging stations by postal code, and check their availability in real time. The project integrates geospatial visualization with a robust backend for an optimal user experience.
